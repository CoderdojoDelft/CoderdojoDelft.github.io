# Coder Dojo Delft website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

This project uses:

- Styled components
- React router
- `gh-pages` to deploy to github pages.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, use the `develop` branch, the `master` branch contains the built JavaScript that is deployed on github.

To share your contributions, please open a pull request.

## Developing

Checkout the develop branch locally. Then run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Our beautiful website will open at http://localhost:3000/.

## Deploying

The website is hosted on Github Pages.
Every commit to the `develop` branch is automatically built 
and deployed by [Travis-CI].

The website can be deployed manually by running:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will build the website, 
commit the build output to the master branch, 
and push the master branch to Github.
